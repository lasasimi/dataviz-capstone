Capstone Project for Coursera Data Visualization & Dashboarding with R Specialization

This is the final assignment for a course that I took to learn R for data visualization.

The course link is here: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-visualization-dashboarding-with-r"> https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-visualization-dashboarding-with-r </a>

I found the course helpful and suitable for people with some background in Excel/GSheets data visualization a little background in survey analysis and want to improve their skills in making easy-to-read visualization for somewhat large datasets. It also taught us to use flexdashboard and using Shinyapp to create interactive dashboards so the viewer can select specific variables they want to see, similar to using Google Data Studio.

Finished this course back then in Oct 2021.
