Capstone Project for Coursera Data Visualization & Dashboarding with R Specialization

This is the final assignment for a course that I took to learn R for data visualization.

The course link is here: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-visualization-dashboarding-with-r"> https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-visualization-dashboarding-with-r </a>

I found the course helpful and suitable for people with some background in Excel/GSheets data visualization a little background in survey analysis and want to improve their skills in making easy-to-read visualization for somewhat large datasets.
